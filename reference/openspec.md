# Open API specifications

Thank you for your interest in learning more about the new APIs and features that we are designing. We will make early versions of the API specifications available here for community feedback. Your input will go a long way toward ensuring that the final design meets the use cases that are important to you. 

The features described here might be in different stages of development, such as early design or public preview. When the feature is generally available, the content will be removed from this page and we will update our documentation to include the details of the new feature. 

_**Important:** The features listed here are still in the design and review phase and are not yet generally available. These features and APIs are subject to change._

## New Excel JavaScript APIs
Join us in reviewing our design for new Excel JavaScript APIs. New and updated APIs include customXML parts, Pivot Table refresh, range filtered view, Range and table as image, append multiple rows to table, and more. 

**See the [Excel JavaScript 1.3 API page](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/tree/ExcelJs_1.3_OpenSpec) to learn more and provide your feedback.**

## New Word JavaScript APIs
The Word JavaScript API 1.3 update contains the largest set of changes we've implemented since this API was introduced. With the new API, you’ll be able to: 

* Create and alter documents in memory
* Create and access list objects
* Create and access table objects
* Have more options for accessing and comparing range objects

These changes have been implemented across nearly all Word JavaScript API objects. This functionality is now or will soon be available in preview for Word 2016 on the desktop for both Windows and Mac, and on the iPad. Update your clients to the latest monthly build and start implementing these great features!

## Document properties access
We are working on adding the ability for web add-ins to access (get, set) document-level properties. This feature will allow add-ins to integrate document properties as part of custom workflows or to read/set the document properties. Word and Excel, and potentially PowerPoint, will support this feature. The feature will also work for the Excel REST API (Excel supports the REST service). We’ll introduce the basic design idea and work through the use-cases and code snippets for how the API will work when it is added. We welcome your design feedback.
